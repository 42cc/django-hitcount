DJANGO-HITCOUNT
===============

Basic pluggable app that allows you to track the number of hits/views 
for a particular object (any object in your project).  Simply add the 
appropriate template tag (creates javascript) on an `object_detail`
(or similiar) page and every time that object is viewed by a valid visitor,
you'll get a count.

Most of the documentation is in the source code.

What it is not
--------------

This is not meant to be a user tracking app (see: django-tracking)
or a comprehensive site traffic monitor (see: Google Analytics).

It's meant to simply count views of a particular object.


TO DO:
------

Everything.  Am learning git, so this should be slow going.
